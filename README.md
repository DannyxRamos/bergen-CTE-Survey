## Perkins V Grant Survey Project

As part of my role at Bergen Community College, I contributed to the revision and implementation of surveys supporting the Perkins V Grant. Working in partnership with the Center for Institutional Effectiveness (CIE), the collegeâ€™s grants office, and an external consultant, I helped revise and refine student, faculty, and stakeholder surveys.

### Purpose
These surveys are designed to:
- Collect comprehensive data on Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses offered at the college
- Gather feedback from multiple stakeholders on program effectiveness
- Identify opportunities for program improvement and alignment with labor market needs

### My contributions
- Participated in the review and revision of survey questions to ensure alignment with Perkins V requirements and institutional priorities
- Ensured that surveys captured meaningful quantitative and qualitative data to support program evaluation and improvement
- Supported planning for data collection, analysis, and reporting
