# Perkins V Grant Survey Project

As part of my role at Bergen Community College, I contributed to the revision, implementation, and management of surveys supporting the Perkins V Grant. Working in partnership with the Center for Institutional Effectiveness (CIE), the collegeâ€™s grants office, an external consultant, and using **SurveyMonkey**, I helped refine and deploy the surveys.

## Purpose
These surveys were designed to:
- Collect comprehensive data on Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses offered at the college
- Gather feedback from multiple stakeholders on program effectiveness
- Identify opportunities for program improvement and alignment with labor market needs
- Inform Perkins V program approval processes and guide funding decisions for equipment, tools, and other resources

## My contributions
- Collaborated with an external consultant to revise and improve survey content, structure, and clarity
- Made the strategic decision to open the survey to both:
  - **Students enrolled in CTE programs**
  - **General students taking CTE-designated courses**  
  This ensured we captured feedback from all students benefiting from Perkins V-funded resources
- Adapted the survey using **SurveyMonkey logic** to tailor question sets appropriately for CTE majors and non-majors
- Ensured the survey captured both meaningful **quantitative** and **qualitative** data to support program evaluation and improvement
- Supported planning for survey deployment, data analysis, and reporting

## Tools used
- **SurveyMonkey** (survey design, logic, distribution, data collection)

## Notes
- Due to confidentiality, the actual survey instrument and student responses are not shared here.
- This repository contains a **mock survey template** and **survey design overview** as examples of the approach used.
