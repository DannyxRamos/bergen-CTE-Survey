# Survey Design Overview — Perkins V Grant CTE Survey

## Purpose
This survey was developed as part of Bergen Community College’s Perkins V Grant initiatives to collect meaningful data on students enrolled in Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs, as well as general students taking CTE-designated courses. The goal of the survey was to:
- Support CTE program evaluation and continuous improvement
- Inform Perkins V program approval processes and funding decisions (e.g., for equipment, tools, and other resources)
- Ensure that CTE programs align with student needs, expectations, and future plans

## Target Group
- Students enrolled in CTE programs
- General students taking CTE-designated courses
